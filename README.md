# Microsoft Film Studio: Data Anyalysis & Strategy Recommendations
### Author: Alexis Kedo

 ## Overview
This project analyzes selected characteristics of movies produced from 2010 onward, in order to provide a set of recommendations to guide the actions of a corporation, Microsoft, in its goal to open a movie production studio. The data comes from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), The Numbers, Box Office Mojo, The Movie Database, and Rotten Tomatoes, courtesy of Flatiron School. Descriptive analysis of film release and earnings data shows that a film's popularity varies seasonally and that Microsoft should limit its production efforts to a few genres in order to maximize profitability. Furthermore, a sampling and analysis of most popular actors shows that Microsoft should concentrate their hiring on a select pool of actors who are relatively likely to maximize return on investment.

## Business Problem



### Use The Slide Template

1. Go to [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PaiH1bleXnhiPjTPsAXQSiAK0nkaRlseQIr_Yb-0mz0/copy) to make an editable copy of the slide deck in your own Google Drive account
2. Go to "Slide," select "Change Theme," and pick a theme you like so your presentation doesn't look like everyone else's
3. **For a group project**, click the "Share" button and add your teammates as editors

### Tidy Up Your Project

- Change the file name of the Jupyter Notebook (`dsc-phase1-project-template.ipynb`) to something more descriptive
- Save an appropriately-named PDF version of your slide deck to the repository
- Rename the template readme you've been working in by running `git mv TEMPLATE_README.md README.md`
- Delete unnecessary files from the repo using `git rm`
   - The presentation PDF: `DS_Project_Presentation_Template.pdf`
   - This README file: `README.md`
   - Any unused data files in the `data` folder
   - Any unused images in the `images` folder

### Notes

- The visualizations in the notebook use best practices for visualization that you should try to emulate. For example, they have clear axes, descriptive titles, and appropriate number formatting
- The `dsc-phase1-project-template.ipynb` is intended to be the _final version_ of your project. The first notebook you create will not look like this. You are encouraged to start with a very disorderly notebook and clean it as you go
